# Data Science Salaries Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a dataset of data science salaries using Python.  
The goal is to clean the data, understand salary distributions, and visualize trends across experience levels, job roles, and work characteristics.

## Dataset
- Source: `ds_salaries.csv`
- Size: 3,755 rows
- Focuses on salaries converted to USD for consistent comparison

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data loading and manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization

## Key Steps
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Checked and confirmed no missing values
- Removed redundant salary columns
- Renamed categorical values for better readability (e.g., experience level, company size)
- Performed exploratory data analysis using value counts
- Visualized experience-level distribution with count plots

## Example Analysis
- Salary trends by experience level
- Distribution of employment types and company sizes
- Remote work ratio analysis
- Global comparison using employee and company locations

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `ds_salaries.csv` is in the project directory
3. Open the notebook and run all cells

## Output
The project produces cleaned datasets and visual insights that help understand patterns in data science salaries across roles, experience levels, and regions.
